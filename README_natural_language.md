# Natural Language Processing of Books Using Python

## Project Description

**Overview :**  
The aim of this project is to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze books programmatically using Python. The project focuses on extracting valuable insights from the text, including the identification of chapters, locating sentences with specific words, determining the most common words, and conducting sentiment analysis to evaluate the emotional tone of each chapter.
